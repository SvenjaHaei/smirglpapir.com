							<p>Transforming a truck into a van:</p>
							<ol style="margin-top:-30px;">
								<li>Interior planning: For interior planning we used SketchUp. The planning upfront is very important so (1) you know how much you need of which ressource and (2) becuase with planning so many things in such a small space you will definitely otherwise make mistakes. For example whilst planning we found out that if we would have gone for the initially planned height of the bed, we would have had not enough space to sit on the table once transforming the bed into a seating area.</li>
								<li>Clean-up: Clear out the van and clean it. A step that takes way longer than you expect, but is also very rewarding :). Afterwards one of my most favorite parts: rust control, sanding and painting.</li>
								<li>Windows: The most scary part for me as it means cutting actual wholes in the truck's metal walls. We installed one side window and a roof ventilator.</li>
								<li>Isolation: Isolation against sound while driving is done with alubutyl. It's a heavy material to avoid the thin metal walls to shake too much while driving. For temperature isolation and to avoid water formation in the interior we used Armaflex on all sides and the roof. On the floor we used XPS panels for better stability.</li>
								<li>Floor: Add a base plate and flooring by choice. We reused the initial base plate and added a tile foil in the kitchen and a PVC flooring in wood optic in the main area. </li>
								<li>Interior facade: Felt for the walls and wooden planks for the roof.</li>
								<li>Power: We added a leisure battery, which is powered by 2 solar panels on the roof and the alternator in the car. The battery status can be checked via an app. 12V and USB sockets can be found throughout the van. </li>
								<li>Heating: The parking heater, which is connected to the diesel tank, has two hot air outlets and comes with the associated fire extinguisher prescribed by the TÜV.</li>
								<li>Lights: There are 6 LED spotlights on the ceiling. The two LED spots in the front area have a switch directly next to the side door and one inside. The four LED spots in the rear area have a shared dimmer switch. There is also a light chain that is separately battery-operated. </li>
								<li>Furniture: We installed a bed that can be converted to a dining area, kitchen countertops including drawers and wall cabinets.</li>
								<li>Kitchen: There is a camping gas stove that is permanently installed in accordance with the TÜV Regulation. It can be pulled outside. There is a cool box that can also be used as a freezer box. There is a fresh water tank and a gray water tank, each of which is connected to the sink/tap. Both hold 20 liters each.</li>
